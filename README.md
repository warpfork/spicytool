SpicyTool
=========

`spicytool` is a CLI tool to generate Spicy Signatures.
You can use it in roles similar to how you'd use `gpg -s`.

Spicy Signatures provide authenticity guarantees in ways similar to familiar signature systems based on asymmetric cryptography primitives,
but are based on append-only verifiable log structures instead of asymmetric crypto.
These "transparency logs" allow both verifiable sequencing of events, and aggregation of witnessing of events,
in ways that offer security even beyond what simple asymmetric signatures can provide in isolation.

SpicyTool is a work in progress.

and the primitives and implementation design choices behind them!
